 * The original .NET implementation of the SimMetrics library is taken from the Java
 * source and converted to NET using the Microsoft Java converter.
 * It is not clear who made the initial convertion to .NET.
 * 
 * This updated version has started with the 1.0 .NET release of SimMetrics and used
 * FxCop (http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/) to highlight areas where changes needed 
 * to be made to the converted code.
 * 
 * this version with updates Copyright (c) 2006 Chris Parkinson.
 * 
 * For any queries on the .NET version please contact me through the 
 * sourceforge web address.
 * 
 * SimMetrics - SimMetrics is a java library of Similarity or Distance
 * Metrics, e.g. Levenshtein Distance, that provide float based similarity
 * measures between string Data. All metrics return consistant measures
 * rather than unbounded similarity scores.

 * Please Feel free to contact me about this library, I would appreciate
 * knowing quickly what you wish to use it for and any criticisms/comments
 * upon the SimMetric library.
